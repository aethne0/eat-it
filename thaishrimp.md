## instructions

BEFORE YOU START: puree the onions in a food processor

OK
1. preheat pot (hot!) and put a good bit (plenty!) of oil (pref. ghee) and add:
    - ~1 tsp mustard seeds
    - ~1-2 dry chilis
    - ~2-3 green cardamom
2. once theyre sizzled for about a minute add PUREED onions (watch your eyes!)
    - caramelize pureed onion for maybe 25-30 mins? you can adjust to taste. I don't like them over-done for this one.
    - add water if theyre sticking/browning to the bottom - i boil water in a kettle and keep it on hand
    - MEANWHILE you should make the spice mix for next step AND puree stuff for the step after.
3. add spice mix AND some hot water and let it toast for 2-3 minutes, stir frequently, spice mix consists of:
    - ~2.0  tbsp   coriander powder
    - ~1.5  tsp    turmeric
    - ~1.0  tsp    kashmiri red chili
    - ~0.5  tsp    cumin
    - I have about a +-75% error with these so don't worry too much
4. add tomato chili garlic ginger cilantro puree
    - 2-3 tomatos
    - 2ish tbps ginger
    - 2ish tbps garlic
    - hella cilantro (use the stems!)
    - a green chili if you want it spicy
5. add big heap of coconut milk and ground nuts!
    - about a cup (250ml) of coconut milk
    - two very heaping overflowing big hefty tablespoons of ground nuts
    - you can adjust as needed to get the right consistency, depends on how watery the tomatoes were etc.
6. let that all roast for a good while, 15-20 mintes, til the raw tomato/garlic/etc is cooked out a bit (to taste).
    - taste and add salt here if needed to!
7. add shrimp and let them just warm up and cook through a tiny bit (if theyre precooked)
8. add fresh cilantro/green chili/ginger to finish
9. eat shrimp


probably itd be better if you marinate and grill the shrimp or cook them from raw and save the broth to use or whatever but i just made this to get some frozen shrimp out of my freezer so
